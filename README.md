## Backend Technology

**SourDuckWannaBet** uses **ASP.NET** and **C#** for its backend, ensuring high performance, security, and scalability. The backend is seamlessly connected to a **Supabase** database, providing real-time capabilities and secure data management.

### Supabase Database Integration

SourDuckWannaBet leverages **Supabase** for backend database services, using a **PostgreSQL** database to manage users, bets, and transactions.

1. **User Management**:
   - User profiles are stored securely in the `users` table with data like usernames, balances, and betting history.
   - Authentication and security are managed by Supabase for ease and safety.
  
2. **Betting System**:
   - All bets are tracked in the `bets` table, with details such as participants, amounts, bet statuses, and timestamps.
   - Real-time updates from Supabase ensure instant feedback on bet actions and balance changes.

3. **Transaction History**:
   - Financial transactions, including bet placements, modifications, and payouts, are stored in the `transactions` table for full transparency.

4. **Scalability & Performance**:
   - Supabase's PostgreSQL backend provides high scalability to handle large volumes of users and bets efficiently.

5. **API Access**:
   - Supabase's RESTful API allows for easy querying, updating, and managing of data between the frontend and the database.
