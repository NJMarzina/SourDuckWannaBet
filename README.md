2. **Bet Management**:
   - Bets are stored in the `bets` table, which tracks details such as sender, receiver, amounts, status, and timestamps.
   - Supabase's real-time capabilities ensure that users receive instant updates on bet statuses.

3. **Transaction Tracking**:
   - All financial transactions, including bet creation, acceptance, and refunds, are recorded in the `transactions` table.
   - This ensures transparency and provides a complete history of user activity.

4. **Scalability and Performance**:
   - Supabase's PostgreSQL database is highly scalable, ensuring that the app can handle a growing number of users and bets without compromising performance.

5. **RESTful API**:
   - Supabase provides a RESTful API that allows the app to interact with the database seamlessly. This includes querying, inserting, updating, and deleting records.
